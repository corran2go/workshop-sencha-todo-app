# Ext.data.WebSqlProxy

A WebSQL proxy implementation for Sencha Touch based on Grgur Grisogono's implementation for ExtJS4.

Note: due to request, I have decided to release this earlier than I had intended to. It works as expected however there are probably improvements that can be made to the modifications (e.g. the inclusion of the ExtJS4 functions).

A few notes on the modifications:

- added a few of the missing functions from ExtJS4 that are not available in Sencha Touch; and
- extended the Ext.data.Proxy class and updated the calls to the superclass.

General improvements:

- now works with models/tables with '-' in their name.

Enjoy,
